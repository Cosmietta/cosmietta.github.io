Hello!, i am Muizzu Rizqi Layl, my gamer tag is Cosmietta, everyday i stare at my computer because i have nothing to do, well sometimes i fix electronic stuff and messing them up just to learn about it, my dream is to make an IoT tools that can automate anything with ease, just imagine that you can control your entire home with a single phone! It's amazing right? 

anyways, here's a few things I'm interested in:  

- Linux (BETTER THAN WINDOWS!!!)
- Software
- Hardware (especially building stuff with arduino)
- Fixing Electronic (if it's fixable, not worth buying a new one)
- Automotive (Cars and Bikes specifically)

This web is still in development, expect some unpolished stuff, and yeah have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
