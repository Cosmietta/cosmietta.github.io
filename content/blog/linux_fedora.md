## What is Fedora?
Fedora is a Linux distribution developed by the Fedora Project, which is sponsored primarily by Red Hat (a subsidiary of IBM). Itâ€™s a free and open-source operating system known for being cutting-edge, stable, and a testing ground for new technologies that often make their way into Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## Reasons Why You Should Use Linux.
It's one of the most user friendly Linux distro (that's from what I heard lol). it's 100% free to use.  
The reason I use Linux is that my system was really outdated, it's no longer supported by Windows 11, and Windows 10 will not receive any updates in Q3 2025. So I asked my friend to recommend me a Linux distro, and Fedora was choosen!

I kid you not, it's 100000000% better than Windows Microsoft bullshit, the Desktop Environmental (KDE) I use is the default GNOME Fedora Workstation variant (there are more variants according to your needs.), it looks so clean, smooth, and minimalist. And damn this is another reason i like about Linux is that it's fucking open source you can modify it as much as you like to be, and yes it's fuck ton safer than windows that steal your data, you're even fucking immortal with Linux cause 99% of virus are made for Windows. With Linux you can even run it on a toaster, it's truly life changing.

I feel more focused and energized whenever I use Linux to work on my project, I love Linux more than myself.

## It's 2025 not 2013 dawg.
BUT BROOOO!!! LINUX IS COMPLICATED AND NO GAME SUPPORT!!1!11!  
Sybau man, good thing there's Steamdeck (Steamdeck's OS uses Linux), because of that so many games are now supported with Linux because of Steam, so you don't need to worry about no games on Linux anymore, I might try another distros which is **Arch**.

## Conclusion.
So, the conclusion is that Linux is not as complicated as you think, even a regular user can operate a Linux, it is 10x more safe, better, and cooler than Windows.  
**Linux Is The Future.**
